Dashboard widget to find posts and pages by their titles instantly. Start typing and you'll get the first suggestions right away.

== Description ==

Dashboard widget to find posts and pages by their titles instantly. If you, like me are tired of searching for a page or blog post in the list of posts (pages), just to make some changes in it, you'll find this little plugin extremely useful. Once installed, it adds a new widget to your admin dashboard page. With that widget, to access a page or post editor, just type any part of that post title, and the plugin will show up the list of suggestions (post title similar to what you've just typed), with direct links to post editor and post preview. So, install the plugin, activate it, go to your admin dashboard and try to find a post the easy, instant way.
